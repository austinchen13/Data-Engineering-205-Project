    "As stated in the scenario, like most companies, AGM does not want to give out its customer list to 3rd party sales channels.  The downside is, as we have seen, that customer first names, last names, and street addresses will have some variations and not be exact matches.\n",

    "Continuing to withhold customer data can present a time consuming challenge to the data science team. Having to match the incorrect customers with the actual customer data will result in time wasted in validating the data and less time for data analysis and visualization. Around 13.4% of the customers did not match our customer data, and with data coming in every day, it is simply not worth it to constantly validate the customer data and fix typos. \n",
    "\n",
    "Giving customer data to the 3rd party sales channels will increase the productivity of the data science team. Only the first name, last name, and street address are given to the 3rd party sales channels, so there is not much concern regarding the security of the customers. Many online services require a personâ€™s name and address such as online shopping. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, I recommend giving customer data to the 3rd party sales channels. We do not want to spend too much time on validating the unmatching customers in the data. Data security is not a concern as many customers provide their name and address places like credit card companies and online marketplaces. With the ability to have all our customers to analyze, our findings will be more valuable and representative of our customers. \n",
